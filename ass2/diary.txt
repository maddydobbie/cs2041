04/08/19	18:00	23:30	Looked at code and cloned repo. Had a go at understanding the assignment.	

05/08/19	20:30	03:40	Started coding level 0. created login button and register button. Spent most of this 
							time learning about html, javascript and how to code only in js

06/08/19	20:30	05:00	Time flew by tonight! Was much more productive tonight as I had a much better grasp on
				 			js. Managed to almost complete level 0, completed modals for login, registration. Having 
							unresolved issue with loading the feed as its requiring the plagarism log in to fetch feed.

07/08/19	14:00	20:00	Today was really bad. Continued with my issue from yesterday. I messaged Zain for help
							as I had so many problems. After much discussion, he told me firefox oftened has extra
							security and told me how to fix it. That one line took so many hours

09/08/19	20:30	02:00	Today did all the css for level 0 which was a nice break from the hell of yesterday.
							I began level 1. I have begun login services but havent finished. Spent most of the time
							familisaing myself with the api calls

10/08/19	20:30	03:15	Today was extremely productive. Managed to finish login and registration and feeling a lot 
							more confident with the API calls. Feed interface is almost done. No bugs, juest tired so will
							finish tomorrow.

11/08/19	20:30	04:40	Finished off the feed interface and began level 2. Starte with upvotes which was a mistake.
							Decided to leave upvotes and come back to it later as was having issue with populating it onclick.
							Did show comments, was relatively easy.

12/08/19	20:30	03:20	Continued to work on upvotes. Unfortunately I coded the post population extremely poorly
							and it's hard to understand. I had to go back and re-add the ids in so that each one was 
							unique as it was messing with the upvote populations

13/08/19	22:30	04:30	Started by doing the profile fetch which was relatively simple. Went back and fixed upvote issue. 
							Had to write a depop function to depopulate upvote window and also fixed the populate function
							as it was writing over the post ids. I tried to do user upvoting but it was too hard and I gave up.
							Also fixed up my code to make it more readable and going to submit now because this assignment
							has almost killed me.

14/08/19	20:10	21:20	Decided to have one last crack at user upvoting after work and I managed to do it quite quickly.
							Going to resubmit now and I'm very happy with my skill progression during this assignment <3
